Pixed
======
Pixed is a pixel-art editor highly inspired by [Mateusz-Nejman/piskel_touch](https://github.com/Mateusz-Nejman/piskel_touch) (it's my fork of Piskel app)

## Planned features
- Most tools from Piskel Touch
- Touch friendly
- Export to PNG
- Import from PNG/Piskel
- Own project format

## Stack
- Avalonia [AvaloniaUI/avalonia](https://github.com/avaloniaui/avalonia)
- Newtonsoft.JSON [JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json)
- PixiEditor.ColorPicker [PixiEditor/ColorPicker] (https://github.com/PixiEditor/ColorPicker)
- System.Reactive (RX) [dotnet/reactive] (https://github.com/dotnet/reactive)

**Work in progress. Code will be refactored later. More MVVM, more controls, less code-behind.**
